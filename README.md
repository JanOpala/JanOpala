## Hi there 👋

# I'm Jan Opala 
### 🎓💻 Data Science Student at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Sciences, Warsaw University of Technology
### 🎓🧠 Cognitive Science MA Student at Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw
### 🎓🏅 Inter-faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences Graduate, University of Warsaw

I am a passionate double major student who studies at two universities at the same time which is greatly challenging and rewarding as I have an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills in several fields I am interested in.
Currently I am seeking an IT internship where I could obtain some hands-on experience and expand my horizons.
